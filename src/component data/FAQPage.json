        {
          "question": "Is my content encrypted?",
          "answer": "Yes! All content is encrypted using industry-standard AES-256 encryption before being stored. Your content is encrypted on our servers and can only be decrypted using your unique magic words."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can Clipposaurus staff access my content?",
          "answer": "No. Your content is encrypted before storage, and we don't have access to the decryption keys. Only someone with your magic words can decrypt and access your content."
        },
        {
          "question": "What happens to my content after 1 hour?",
          "answer": "After 1 hour, your content is automatically and permanently deleted from our servers. This includes all text, code, files, and associated metadata. There is no backup or recovery option."

          "question": "Do you track or log user activity?",
          "answer": "We use minimal analytics (Vercel Analytics) to understand usage patterns and improve the service. We don't track individual users, and all analytics data is anonymized. We don't use cookies for tracking or advertising."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is Clipposaurus GDPR and CCPA compliant?",
          "answer": "Yes. We comply with GDPR, CCPA, and other data protection regulations. Since content is automatically deleted after 1 hour and we don't store personal information, our service is designed with privacy by default."
        },
        {
          "question": "Where is my data stored?",
          "answer": "Your data is stored on secure cloud infrastructure. Text and code are stored in encrypted Redis databases, while files are stored on enterprise cloud storage providers (Cloudflare R2, Backblaze B2, or Storj) with encryption."

      "questions": [
        {
          "question": "How do I share content?",
          "answer": "Simply paste or upload your content, click 'Save Content', and you'll receive unique magic words. Share these words with anyone who needs access. They can then visit Clipposaurus, enter the words, and instantly access your content."
        },
        {
          "question": "What are magic words?",
          "answer": "Magic words are unique two-word codes (like 'happy-elephant') that serve as the key to access your content. They're easy to remember, type, and share compared to long random strings."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I access my content multiple times?",
          "answer": "Yes! You can access your content as many times as you want within the 1-hour window. The magic words remain valid until the content expires."
        },
        {
          "question": "What happens if I lose my magic words?",
          "answer": "Unfortunately, if you lose your magic words, there's no way to recover your content. The words are the only way to decrypt and access your data. We recommend saving them immediately or keeping the browser tab open."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I share my magic words with multiple people?",
          "answer": "Yes! You can share your magic words with as many people as you want. Everyone who has the words can access the content within the 1-hour timeframe."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I edit content after saving it?",
          "answer": "No. Once content is saved, it cannot be edited. If you need to make changes, you'll need to create a new share with the updated content and new magic words."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is there a limit to how much I can share?",
          "answer": "Text and code are limited to reasonable sizes for performance. Files are limited to 100MB per upload. There's no limit on the number of shares you can create."

      "questions": [
        {
          "question": "Why can't I access my content?",
          "answer": "Common reasons include: 1) Content has expired (1 hour has passed), 2) Magic words were entered incorrectly (check for typos), 3) Network connectivity issues. Make sure you're entering the exact magic words provided when you saved the content."
        },
        {
          "question": "My file upload is failing. What should I do?",
          "answer": "Check that: 1) Your file is under 100MB, 2) You have a stable internet connection, 3) Your browser is up to date. If issues persist, try a different browser or clear your browser cache."
        },
        {
          "question": "The page is loading slowly. How can I fix this?",
          "answer": "Slow loading can be caused by: 1) Poor internet connection, 2) Large file uploads, 3) Browser extensions interfering. Try disabling browser extensions, checking your connection speed, or using a different network."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I extend the 1-hour expiration time?",
          "answer": "No. The 1-hour expiration is a core security feature and cannot be extended. If you need to keep content accessible longer, you'll need to create a new share before the current one expires."
        },
        {
          "question": "Why am I seeing an error message?",
          "answer": "Error messages usually indicate: content expiration, invalid magic words, network issues, or server problems. Try refreshing the page, checking your internet connection, or creating a new share. If the problem persists, the issue may be on our end and we're likely working on it."

          "question": "Can I share content anonymously?",
          "answer": "Yes! Clipposaurus doesn't require any personal information, accounts, or identifying details. Your shares are completely anonymous by default."
        },
        {
          "question": "Does Clipposaurus work offline?",

        },
        {
          "question": "Can I password-protect my content?",
          "answer": "The magic words serve as your password. Since they're required to access the content and are unique to each share, your content is already protected. Only those with the magic words can access it."

          "question": "Is there a dark mode?",
          "answer": "Yes! Clipposaurus includes a dark mode that you can toggle using the theme switcher in the header. Your preference is saved locally in your browser."

          "question": "How is it different from email or messaging apps?",
          "answer": "Clipposaurus is designed for quick, temporary sharing without accounts or app installations. It's perfect for one-time shares across devices or with people you don't regularly communicate with. Content auto-deletes, ensuring privacy."
        },
        {
          "question": "Why not use Google Drive or Dropbox?",

        {
          "question": "What about GitHub Gists?",
